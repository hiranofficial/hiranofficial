# 👋 Hey there, I'm Hiran!  

🚀 **Code Wrangler | AI Dreamer | Entrepreneur on a Mission (and Debugging on the Side)**  

Once upon a time, I wrote a `"Hello, World!"` program. It promptly crashed.  
**That was the day I realized technology and I were in for a long, complicated relationship.**  

Fast forward a few years—I now **build AI-driven platforms, automate the boring stuff, and guide new developers into the thrilling abyss of AI and tech**.  
Somewhere along the way, I also founded a couple of startups (**because why break just code when you can break business models too?**).  

💡 **Coding keeps me awake. Debugging keeps me humble. AI keeps me hopeful.**  


## 🔥 **What I Do (When Not Debugging)**  
- **💻 Writing Code & Pretending to Understand It**  
- **🤖 Building AI That’s Smarter Than Me**  
- **🛠️ Creating Tech Startups & Accidentally Making More Work for Myself**  
- **🎙️ Talking About AI Like I Invented It**  
- **🧑‍🏫 Mentoring Future AI Engineers Before They Discover Debugging**

## 💡 **Projects That Keep Me Up at Night**  
### **Founder, [LucyHR](https://lucyhr.ai)** 🤖  
- AI **agents running around doing HR tasks** so humans don’t have to.  
- Automating **recruitment, career alignment, and compliance and a lot more**—because HR deserves some AI love too!  
- Sometimes, I think the AI works harder than the HR team.  
### **Founder, [Stag AI](https://www.stag-ai.com/) - A Developer-Driven AI Community** 🚀  
- Helping **newbie developers** get into AI **without suffering through bad documentation alone**.  
- We **uplift talent, mentor devs**, and build **cool AI stuff that occasionally works on the first try**.  
### **AI-Powered Document Analysis** 🔍🤐 *(NDA-Protected, but Trust Me, It’s Cool)*  
- Can’t say much, but **it involves AI, documents, and a bit of magic**.  
- If I tell you more, I might have to train an AI model to forget it.  
### **Pricing Simulator for the Energy Sector** ⚡💸  
- A **predictive AI model** that helps energy suppliers **forecast pricing & stay ahead of market trends**.  
- Essentially, **teaching AI how to predict the unpredictable**—thanks, economics!  
### **Smart Document Management System** 📂  
- An AI-powered system that **sorts, categorizes, and retrieves documents** faster than your **average intern**.  
- Sometimes, it even **finds files that you forgot existed**.  
### **Supply Chain Document Processing with OCR** 📦📝  
- Because **manually scanning supply chain documents is so 2005**.  
- Built an AI system that **reads, extracts, and validates critical information** from messy logistics paperwork.  
### **ERP System ETL Automations** 🔄📊  
- Automating **data pipelines** in ERP systems so that businesses can **stop suffering from spreadsheet nightmares**.  
- AI-driven **ETL workflows that move data where it belongs**—without human tears.

## 🚀 **Still Exploring, Always Learning**  
I’m always on a mission to **push the boundaries of AI & software engineering** while helping others grow.  

✨ **AI isn’t just about automation—it’s about making life better (and occasionally terrifying us with deepfakes).**  
✨ **Code isn’t just syntax—it’s a chaotic art form that sometimes compiles.**  
✨ **Tech isn’t just a career—it’s a lifelong adventure of Stack Overflow searches.**

🔥 **Let’s code, break things, fix them (sometimes), and make AI do all the hard work for us.**
